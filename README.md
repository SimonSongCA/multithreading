2. Open a web browser and type http://localhost:8000/search?word= in the search bar. 
3. To query the total appearances of a specific word in the text file under the 'resources' folder(currently war_and_peace.txt), append the word that you would like to search after the equal('=') sign at the end of the search bar content.
4. Hit enter in the search bar. The web page will return the total number of appearences of that specific word.
